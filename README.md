With pappel you can use reactive components in a classic environment,
where servers deliver static html pages. No need to change your entire
eco-system. Written in Typescript.

## Support
Pappel is tested specifically in the latest versions of following
browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and IE. 

We furthermore use [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)
to ensure the highest, possibly affordable browser compatibility. 
[See our config here](.browserslistrc). This is integrated in our
build tasks.
